#' @title Calculate stability from deviation
#'
#' @description A function to calculate stability based on the results of `deviationThroughTime`.
#'
#' @param rasterForCalculation A raster that contains data from which stability is to be calculated.
#'
#' @details This formula takes the inverse of the raster and rescales it from 0 to 1.This function is
#' necessary in cases where there is no deviation in some cells. If time slices are very close
#' together, it's possible that some cells may have values equal to zero, at which point if you
#' simply divide 1 by the raster and rescale the result, you can end up with a raster full of zeroes.

#' @return A raster
